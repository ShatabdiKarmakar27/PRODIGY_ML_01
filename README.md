Implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms is a fundamental task in real estate analytics. By leveraging this model, one can gain insights into the relationship between these key features and housing prices, aiding both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. Square footage serves as a primary determinant of a property's value, with larger spaces typically commanding higher prices. Meanwhile, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms offers insight into the property's functionality and desirability. Through thorough data analysis and model training, one can develop an accurate predictive tool that accounts for these factors, providing valuable guidance in the dynamic housing market.
